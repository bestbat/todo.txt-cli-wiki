There is a .NET Windows GUI app that sits in your system tray: https://github.com/benrhughes/todotxt.net/downloads

Windows PowerShell version (think todo.sh for Windows): https://github.com/hartez/todo.txt-PowerShell

Additionally, there was also an AutoHotKey gui version that was advertised a couple months back on the list--maybe it might meet your needs, if you're looking for more of a GUI version...
