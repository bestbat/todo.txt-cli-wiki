h1(#install). Installation

To learn how to install (and create) add-ons, see [[Creating and Installing Add-ons]].

h1. Filters

Since version 2.4, _todo.sh_ provides @TODOTXT_SORT_COMMAND@ and @TODOTXT_FINAL_FILTER@, which can be used to modify the list commands' output.

h2(#futuretasks). Future Tasks

Hide tasks containing a date threshold (@t:YYYY-MM-DD@) until the specified point in the future.

Note: The @date@ command "can be used":http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/todotxt/message/1843 to append date thresholds (e.g. @todo.sh append <#> "t:`date -d '1 day' +%F`"@).
The "schedule":http://github.com/FND/todo.txt-cli/blob/extensions/schedule extension provides a wrapper for this.

The @-x@ "option":http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/todotxt/message/2402 can be used to temporarily disable filtering and also display future tasks.
