h3. _replace_ command does not report original item

On @todo.sh replace@, the original item isn't listed in the replace output.

h3. problem in sorting items: some non-prioritized interleaved in prioritized

Example:

@075 +aaa test todotxt
033 (A) +proj1 ...
041 (B) +proj1 ...
074 +breaking_project
111 (C) +proj3 ...@

I don't see how to solve it easily with "sort", the only way I see is to explicitly show and sort prioritized items then show and sort other items. Anybody has an idea how to do it nicely within the new _list()?
