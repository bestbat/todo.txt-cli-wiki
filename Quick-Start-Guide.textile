Here's how to install and run the Todo.txt CLI:

0. (Windows only:) "Download and install Cygwin":http://cygwin.com/install.html. Cygwin provides a Unix-environment for Windows; Todo.txt needs just the Bash shell and some common Unix tools, so a minimal installation will do just fine. 

1. "Download the latest stable release of Todo.txt CLI":http://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/downloads (available as a ZIP or TAR archive) and extract it.

2. Open a command window. On Windows, this is _Cygwin Bash Shell_ (_not_ Command Prompt!); elsewhere, this is often called _Terminal_. It usually presents you with a @$@ prompt. @cd@ into the directory where you extracted todo.sh. Make the todo.sh script executable:

<pre>
      $ chmod +x todo.sh
</pre>

3. Type @./todo.sh@ to see the usage message. You're ready to go!  To start adding tasks, type @./todo.sh add "My new task"@
