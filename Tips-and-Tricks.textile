*Access todo.sh from anywhere in the file tree.* Add the following to your ~/.bashrc file (~/.bash_profile for Mac and Cygwin users):

<pre>
          PATH=$PATH:"/path/to/your/todo/scripts"
</pre>

*Avoid typing todo.sh every time.* Add the following to your @~/.bashrc file@ (@~/.bash_profile@ for Mac and Cygwin users):

<pre>
          alias t='todo.sh -d /path/to/your/todo.cfg'
</pre>

Then you simply type @t add laundry@ from anywhere in your file tree to add a task.

*Hide the configuration file by renaming it @.todo.cfg@.*

Access your remote server's @todo.txt@ via ssh. If you have a shell account on @remote.server.com@, alias your @todo.sh@ commands to do the same thing as usual but prepend @ssh username@remote.server.com@ to them. Something like:

<pre>
      ssh username@remote.server.com todo.sh list
</pre>

Displays the remote todo list.

*Integrate your todo.txt onto your desktop*
